      For 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive. As the
      world's leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100
      countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to
      develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect communities,
      wildlife, and the places in which they live.
    </blockquote>
